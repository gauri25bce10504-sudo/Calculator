Problem Statement

Performing basic arithmetic operations is a fundamental requirement in everyday tasks, education, and software development. However, many beginners struggle to understand how simple calculators work internally and how programming logic can be used to build such tools.

This project aims to develop a Python-based Calculator that can perform essential arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The goal is to create a simple, user-friendly, and menu-driven application that demonstrates the use of Python functions, conditional statements, loops, and error handling.

The problem addressed by this project is to provide a lightweight, easy-to-understand calculator program that helps beginners grasp core programming concepts while offering a functional tool for performing calculations. It also lays a foundation for future enhancements like scientific operations or graphical interfaces.

Scope of the Project

The scope of this project focuses on designing and developing a basic Python-based Calculator capable of performing fundamental arithmetic operations. The project covers the following areas:

Implementation of Core Operations
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using Python functions.

Command-Line Interaction
A simple, menu-driven interface that allows users to select operations and input values.

Input Validation & Error Handling
Ensuring that invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values or division by zero, are handled gracefully.

Modular Program Structure
Breaking the program into reusable functions for clarity and maintainability.

User-Friendly Workflow
Allowing continuous calculations until the user chooses to exit.

Beginner-Level Application
Intended for students.
Here is a clear and professional Target Users section for your calculator project:
