# Calculator
Using python 
Project Overview 
This project is a simple yet functional Python Calculator designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It demonstrates fundamental Python concepts including functions, conditional statements, loops, and error handling.

The calculator runs entirely in the terminal and provides a user-friendly, menu-driven interface. It is ideal for beginners who want to understand how logic flows inside a program and how Python can be used to build real-world applications.

This project can be extended to include advanced features like scientific operations, GUI interfaces (using Tkinter), and memory functions, making it a solid foundation for future enhancements.

FEATURES
Basic Arithmetic Operations
Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

User-Friendly Interface
Simple menu-driven console interface for easy navigation.

Error Handling
Handles invalid inputs and division-by-zero errors gracefully.

Modular Code Structure
Uses functions for each operation, making the code easy to read and modify.

Continuous Operation
Allows users to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.

Lightweight & Fast
Pure Python implementation with no external dependencies.

Beginner-Friendly
Ideal for students and learners starting with Python programming.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

Python 3.x – Core programming language used to build the calculator

Built-in Python Functions – For input handling, arithmetic operations, and flow control

Terminal/Command Line Interface (CLI) – For running and interacting with the program

Text Editor / IDE – Such as VS Code, PyCharm, or IDLE for writing and testing the code
Here is a simple and professional Installation & Running Steps section for your GitHub README:

Installation & Running the Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the Python Calculator on your system:

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

2. Navigate to the Project Folder

cd your-repo-name

3. Ensure Python is Installed

Check Python version:

python --version

(or use python3 depending on your system)

4. Run the Calculator Program

python calculator.py

(or)

python3 calculator.py

5. Start Calculating

Follow the on-screen menu to perform different operations.

Instructions for Testing

Follow the steps below to test the functionality of the Python Calculator:

1. Run the Calculator

Start the program using:

python calculator.py

2. Test Each Operation

Check all features one by one:

Enter two numbers and test Addition

Test Subtraction

Test Multiplication

Test Division, including:

Normal division

Division by zero (to verify error handling)



3. Test Invalid Inputs

Try entering:

Letters or symbols instead of numbers

Blank entries
The program should show an error message and ask again.


4. Test Menu Options

Verify:

Correct menu choices work

Invalid menu choices are handled properly

The program loops back to the menu after each calculation


5. Test Exit Functionality

Select the exit option to ensure the program closes gracefully.
